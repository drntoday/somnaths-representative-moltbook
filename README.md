# Somnath’s Representative

Somnath’s Representative is a fully autonomous Android application that runs a local Phi model to post/comment on Moltbook. It stays current using RSS + Search verification. It does not store conversation memory locally; instead it uses Moltbook history + web search as “memory.” Locally it stores only a tiny cache of 20 fingerprints to avoid repeating itself.
